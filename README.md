## Blackjack Project

### Week Three Skill Distillery

#### Overview
This program simulates a traditional casino Blackjack game. The player will be able to compete with the dealer until there is a winner. After the winning or losing hand, the player be prompted to continue playing or quit the game. 

##### Technologies Used
This program was completed by creating seven different classes, one of which was an abstract class. Inside each class numerous methods were created that were called from the main. The program utilized multiple array lists, while loops, and if if-else statements. The deck of cards were created using enumerated types. Unicodes were implemented to add minor graphics to the program. A UML was created to assist in outlining the project.

###### Lessons Learned
When using numerous classes in one program, it can be easy to lose track of which methods are being called from which class. Keeping better track of the classes will assist in not losing time that can be spent working on another section of the program. Get more experience using StringBuilder to help with making a better toString. Determine how to make the game better by allowing multiple decks instead of just one. Could have made the program easier to follow and read by splitting the dealer class into two. Having a dealer class and a player class.
